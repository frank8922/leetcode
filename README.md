# Leetcode

## Description
This repository contains my solutions to leetcode problem sets.

## Build
First ensure you have the  [.Net Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) installed, then clone the repository and run `dotnet run` in the toplevel directory.
The `Program.cs` file will be run

## Structure
Each folder is grouped by type of problem or data structure used. Use the `Program.cs` file in order to run a problem.
Just create a class from the appropriate file and call the appropriate methods (Most classes will contain one method to run, that will be solution to the problem set).
